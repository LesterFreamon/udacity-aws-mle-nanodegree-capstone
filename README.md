# Project: JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange Prediction

## Project Proposal
I propose to complete the JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange Prediction project. The project will involve predicting the future returns of Japanese equities and creating an optimal portfolio strategy.

### Domain Background
The project is situated in the domain of quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. Traditionally, investment decisions were made manually by financial professionals. However, with advancements in technology and data science, there's a growing trend towards quantitative trading, where investment decisions are executed programmatically based on predictions from trained models. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze the Japanese stock market and develop a profitable trading strategy.


### Problem Statement
The core problem is to predict the future returns of approximately 2,000 stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. More specifically, the challenge is to rank these stocks from highest to lowest expected returns on a daily basis. The goal is to create a portfolio strategy that maximizes the difference in returns between the top 200 and bottom 200 ranked stocks.


### Datasets and Inputs
The project will use several datasets provided by the Japan Exchange Group (JPX):

1. stock_prices.csv: Daily closing prices for each stock and the target column.
2. options.csv: Data on various market options.
3. secondary_stock_prices.csv: Data on less liquid securities.
4. trades.csv: Aggregated summary of trading volumes from the previous business week.
5. financials.csv: Results from quarterly earnings reports.
6. stock_list.csv: Mapping between security codes and company names, including industry information.

These datasets cover different time windows and will be updated periodically during the competition.

### Solution Statement
The proposed solution will involve developing a machine learning model that can effectively rank stocks based on their expected future returns. This will likely involve:

1. Extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Time series analysis techniques to capture temporal patterns.
3. A machine learning algorithm (e.g., gradient boosting, neural networks) to predict stock returns.
4. A ranking mechanism to order stocks based on predicted returns.
5. A portfolio construction strategy to maximize the spread between top and bottom-ranked stocks.

### Benchmark Model
A simple benchmark model could be a strategy that ranks stocks based on their returns over the past week or month. This momentum-based approach is often used in quantitative finance and would provide a baseline to compare our more sophisticated model against.

### Evaluation Metrics
The primary evaluation metric for this project is the Sharpe Ratio of the daily spread returns. This metric measures the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio strategy. It's calculated by:

1. Ranking each stock active on a given day.
2. Treating the top 200 ranked stocks as purchased and the bottom 200 as shorted.
3. Weighting the stocks based on their ranks.
4. Calculating total portfolio returns assuming stocks were purchased the next day and sold the day after that.

A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.

### Project Design
The project will follow these main steps:

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Analyze the provided datasets, handle missing values, and create relevant features.

2. Feature Engineering: Develop features that capture market trends, company fundamentals, and other relevant factors.

3. Model Development: Implement and train a machine learning model to predict stock returns.

4. Ranking System: Develop a method to rank stocks based on the model's predictions.

5. Portfolio Strategy: Create a portfolio construction strategy that maximizes the spread between top and bottom-ranked stocks.

6. Backtesting: Test the strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance.

7. API Integration: Implement the solution using the provided Python time-series API to ensure no forward-looking bias.

8. Optimization and Iteration: Continuously refine the model and strategy based on performance results.

This project will provide valuable insights into quantitative trading strategies and the Japanese stock market, while also developing skills in time series analysis, machine learning, and financial modeling.
